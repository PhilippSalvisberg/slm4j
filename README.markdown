Starschema License Manager for java (slm4j)
=========

Slm4j project aimed to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-implement license manager system for java projects. 

Basic functionality
-------------------

The project includes a command line tool to generate private and public keys for cryptographical signing, and a runtime class (or jar module) to validate the generated keys. 

The signed data is an ASCII armored file, which could store date or time limitations, functionality restrictions or any user specified strings. The embedded license file validator ensures that file is not modified by using DSA algorythm.


Example license file
--------------------

The following file was generated by slm4j:

<pre>
----- BEGIN LICENSE -----
ExpirationDate=200906030
Version=Full
----- END LICENSE -----
----- BEGIN SIGNATURE -----
MCwCFCKRoTnYFdE7JJzH
W2XQddSq9wqCR43hRQ+J
BZV5FS+ZU5j90JAZFUA2
WQ==
----- END SIGNATURE -----
</pre>

Any changes in license data will cause an invalid license exception.
